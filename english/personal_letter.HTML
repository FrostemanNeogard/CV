        Hi. My name's Liam and I'm an 18 year old self taught codehobbyist from Stockholm with an interest 
        for frontend development. I have been coding on my spare time for around 2 years as well as done a couple related projects 
        in school. <br><br>

        Due to how new I am to the industry, I don't have a flashy portfolio or a lot of relevant work 
        experiences; however, I created the attached CV with HTML and CSS.
